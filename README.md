# Game-Dev
Escape game project on Game Dev Curse
You start in a dark room. You do not know why you are here. You have to find clues in order to go out of the building.

Game in development, any advice would be grateful.

---*What has to be done*--

PRIMARY
- block the utilisation of already used objects (like do not take the rope 2 times)
- make the personage move before to interact with object (inside the hub and inside the room3) //boring ?
- make the objects out of the inventory when it is used

SECONDARY
- change size of the person on the first room (and maybe others ?)
- implante a timer
- double click pour arrêter de marcher après avoir cliqué sur un objet => assez relou
